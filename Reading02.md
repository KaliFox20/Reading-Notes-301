## React Lifecycle

React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

3 Phases of component lifecycle :
Mounting - When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

 Updating - Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.

static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps

 Unmounting - The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM.

## React State VS Props

State: The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component

Props: Props‚Äù is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
