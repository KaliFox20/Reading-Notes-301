## Google and the Perfect Team

This article was quite interesting to see how big tech companies are trying to quantify what makes a good team. I think their intention was good, but I think they way they went about it was wrong. When I gleaned this article it failed to define what they consider perfect. So trying to find what they deemed perfect was very arbitrary, and in the end the reason why they came up with inconclusive results.

## How I explained REST to my Brother

1. Roy Fielding is an American Computer Scientist that was one of the principal authors of HTTP specification and created REST architectual style.

2. The techniques we use today dont work well when trying to talk to all machines is beacuse we usually only need to talk to a small group of machines.

3. HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is about applying nouns and verbs to interface with other machines. 

4. GET is used to retrieve and request data from a server. 

5. POST is used to send data to a server.

6. PUT is used to update the state of a server. 

7. PATCH makes partial changes to an exisiting resource.
