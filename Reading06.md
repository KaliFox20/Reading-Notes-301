## Intro to Node.js

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

## Pair Programming

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

Driver: The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

Navigator: The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
