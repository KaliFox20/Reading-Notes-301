# API Designs and best practices

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer 

2. They are designed around Resources

3. A URI is an indentifier of a resource. An exampe of this would be https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

4. The most common HTTP verbs would be GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

5. URIs should be based on nouns (the resource)

6. https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

7. "Chatty" APIs are a bad thing because they expose a large number of small resources
